<h1>How to Troubleshoot</h1>
-unlike home networks where you can easily change settings, large corporations ensure no mistakes by using protocols in order to change settings
**Change Protocol**:
	-A formal process for changes to be made in a controlled environment where if any mistakes are made then you can roll back to a version that works
	-Plan for change, estimate risk with the change, have a recovery plan in place, test before making the change, document all of this and get approval THEN make the change

1) *Identify the Problem:* 
	a) get as many details as possible by talking to the user and duplicate the issue if possible, 
	b) may be more than one single symptom
	c) backup everything so you can rollback if necessary 
	d) se what has been changed by using the documentation or log files
2) *Establish a Theory*: 
	a) start with the obvious (loose cable, plugged in?)
	b) consider everything by making a list with obvious at the top of it
	c) research the symptoms by using google or internal knowledge bases
3) *Test the Theory*:
	a) confirm the theory by testing the items on your list of theories 
	b) if you've gone through entire list then bring in a 3rd party
4) *Create a plan of action*:
	a) build the plan to correct the issue with minimum impact
	b) refer to the vendor instructions (documentation/manuals/articles)
	c) every plan can go bad so have a plan b, c, etc
5) *Implement the plan*:
	a) Fix the issues during the time provided to you by change control board
	b) escalate as necessary to get help from a 3rd party
6) *Verify Full System functionality*:
	a) issue isn't fixed until it's really fixed (confirmed by tests/users)
	b) implement preventative measures to ensure it doesn't happen in the future
7) *Document findings*:
	a) it's not fully over until you build your knowledge base
	b) if same issue is found again then we have documentation on how to fix it
