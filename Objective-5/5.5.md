<h1>Troubleshooting Mobile Devices</h1>
**Poor battery health**: Phone batteries only have so many recharges 
	-bad reception will mean it is always searching for a signal and thus using more battery (use airplane mode if you know you won't have service)
	-you can check which apps are using the most battery in settings
**Swollen battery**: buildup of gas that is designed to be contained
	-DO NOT open the battery packet (fire risk)
	-IF faulty then dispose of it properly
**Broken Screen**:
	-backup first if it's operational
	-glass is sharp so replace the screen
**Improper charging**:
	-check that the charging port is not obstructed (dust, etc)
	-check the cable (don't use frayed cables, check it on another device)
	-verify the power adapter (check with a multimeter)
**Poor or no connectivity**:
	-location, location, location determines your signal strength
	-Cellular has great signal strength especially when outside
	-WiFi has limited range and signal can be interfered with 
**Liquid damage**: DON'T MESS WITH THE DEVICE IF IT HAS WATER DAMAGE
	-many phones have a LCI (Liquid contact indicator) that turns a color if it comes in contact with a liquid
	-power down the phone and remove all accessories (silica gel is better than rice in drying your phone out)
**Overheating**:
	-phone will automatically shut down to avoid heating damage
	-charging the phone/CPU usage/display light all create heat
**Digitizer Issues**: touchscreen completely black and not responding to input
	-Apple IOS reset (hold power and volume for 10 seconds)
	-Android reset (remove battery and put it back in OR hold power and volume until restart)
**Physically damaged ports**: 
	-rough handling or accidents that cause plethora of issues (only charges if at a certain angle)
	-not modular and usually requires a system board replacement
**Malware**:
	-pop up messages, unusual apps, large data transfers that you didn't start, high cpu usuage and device overheating easily 
**Cursor drift**:
	-random input or cursor moves without touching the device 
	-use a touch calibration app
