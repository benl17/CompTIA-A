<h1>Troubleshooting Common Hardware Problems</h1>
**POST (power on self test)**:tests major system components before boot like CPU, Video, memory
	-failures are noted with beeps and/or codes (depends on BIOS)
**POST and boot**: LISTEN TO THE BEEPS
	-could be bad video/ram/cpu or a BIOS configuration issue
	- *BIOS time&setting*: replace battery that maintains this

**Windows Stop Error (blue screen of death)**: means there was a fatal error booting up your computer and it needs to be restarted
	-startup and shutdown BSOD 
	-use Last known good configuration or roll back drivers 
	-Repeat or remove the hardware that is causing problems
	-Run hardware diagnostic from BIOS or hardware manufacturer 
**Spinning wait cursor(Spinning ball of death)**: feedback from the system that something is happening and needs to complete before you can continue
	-if it never stops THEN you have to restart computer (check console logs to see why it happened)
	-bad hardware, application bug, slow paging to disk
**Black Screen**:
	-check monitor is connected first, cables work, input is correctly selected
	-swap monitor to see if it is your monitor or computer
	-no video after Windows Load?-> use VGA mode(F8)
**No Power**: check outlet, then power supply using hardware inside computer like is the fan power connected? or is the motherboard fried and not working
**Sluggish performance**:
	-task manager to see what is taking up CPU utilization
	-Windows update is downloading/installing new patches
	-Disk space is used up so you can't write data to it
	-laptops may be using power saving mode which throttles CPU 
**Overheating**:
	-check that your cooling systems are cleaned properly (no dust)
	-use monitoring software for checking temperatures (can be done through BIOS or other software)
**Intermittent Shutdown**:Event Viewer and Device Manager are helpful
	-Heat related-> high CPU or graphics temp so check all fans/heat sinks
	-could be failing hardware so run diagnostics in Device Manager
**Application Crashes**:
	-Event Log and Reliability Monitor (lists all failures and lists the actuall failure) are helpful
	-try to reinstall with newest version
**Grinding Noises**: you never want to hear a grinding noise
	-Rattling or loose components
	-scraping noise is probably hard drive problem
	-clicking is probably fan problem
	-pop is probably a capacitor problem (capacitor with a bulging top)
**Lockups**: system completely stops
	-check for any activity like a hard drive status light or CTRL-ALT-DEL
	-update drives and software patches
	-Low resources like RAM or storage
**Continuous reboots**:
	-need to know where it is rebooting ie->at log in page or is it not getting past BIOS in order to know what you have to do to fix it
