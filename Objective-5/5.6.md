<h1>Troubleshooting Printers</h1>
**Test the printer**: print a test page through Windows or printer settings page

**Line down the printed page**:
	*Inkjet*-> clean the printer heads
	*Laser*->. check for scratched photosensitive drum
**faded prints/blank pages**:
	*Laser*-> low toner
	*Inkjet*-> low ink
**Double/Echo image**:
	*Laser*-> optical drum not cleaned properly
**Garbled print**:
	-bad printer driver/wrong model 
	-check with a test page and change drivers as needed
**Toner not sticking to the paper**: toner was not fused to the paper properly 
	-replace the fuser assembly
**Paper size mismatch**: printer will stop and give you a chance to select the correct page size
**Paper jam**:
	*paper not feeding*-> check tray and replace rollers as needed
	*creased paper*-> problems in the paper path, check paper weight
**Corrupted Print jobs**: multiple jobs will be added but nothing will be printed 
	-print spool will crash but will usually automatically restart
	-Windows Event View/Windows-Print Service allow you to locate the job causing the issue and delete it
**Incorrect color settings**:
	-calibrate the monitor to ensure you're actually seeing the correct colors
	-calibrate the printer as well
**Grinding Noises**: usually mechanical so maintenance and extra parts required
	-could be a paper jam or the carriage (inkjet) is stalled or jammed
	-each printer is different so check the printer documentation
