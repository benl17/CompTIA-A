<h1>Troubleshooting Storage Devices</h1>
**Storage Failure Symptoms**:
	*Read/Write Failure*-> "cannot read from the source disk"
	*Slow performance*-> constant LED activity, retry/retry/retry
	*Loud clicking noise*-> click of death, grinding/scraping too
**Troubleshooting storage failure**:
	-GET A BACKUP ASAP
	-check for loose or damaged cables
	-check for overheating 
	-check power supply, may be using too much power
	-run hard drive diagnostics (usually manufacture provides one)

**Boot failure symptoms**:
	*drive not recognized*-> beeps/error messages/lights (or no lights)
	*OS not found*-> drive is present but OS is not
**Troubleshooting boot failures**:
	-check your cables
	-check the boot sequence in BIOS (the order of drives checked by BIOS in order to boot the OS) IF USB IS LEFT IN THEN THIS MAY PREVENT OS BOOT
	-if newly installed then check data and power cables or try SATA interface

**Data loss/corruption**:
	-hard drives are mechanical (spinning parts) 
	-important to always keep backups
	-SSD are also susceptible to failure

**S.M.A.R.T (Self-monitoring, analysis, reporting technology**:
	-uses third party utilities and has A LOT of information to help you

*IOPS (input/output operations per second)*-> very useful metric when comparing performance across drives 
	-hard drive: 200 IOPS
	-SSD: 1,000,000 IOPS
