<h1>Troubleshooting Networks</h1>
**No network connectivity**:
	-check the router to see if any lights are on showing traffic
	1)Ping loopback (127.0.0.1)-> if we get a ping back then the internal networking of our device is working
	2)Ping local IP-> checks local config, adapter and link signal
	3)Ping default gateway
	4)pint devices on routers side (internet side)
**Intermittent Wireless connectivity**:
	*Interference*->something else if using our frequency
	*Signal strength*-> transmitting signal/antenna, receiving antenna
	*Incorrect channel*-> usually automatic but look for manual tuning
	*Bounce & Latency*-> signals bounce off objects so move somewhere else
**Wireless interference:**
	-microwaves, cordless phones, high power sources can all interfere 
	-Multi-tenant building can also interfere
	*SNR (signal to noise ratio)* is a good measurement for this
		-you want a LARGE ratio (1:1 is BAD)
**Limited to no connectivity**: "Limited to no connectivity/No internet access"
	-Check the local IP (an APIPA means it is only local connection)
	-if DHCP address was assigned then use same steps as above 
**Jitter**: most real time media (like a call) is sensitive to delay and cannot be replayed
	-*Jitter*: is the time between frames and an EXCESSIVE amount can cause you to miss information or have choppy voice calls
