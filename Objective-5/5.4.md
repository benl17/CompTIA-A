<h1>Troubleshooting Video & Display Issues</h1>
**No video image:**
	-ensure that all cables are plugged in/cable isn't broken
	-ensure the correct input is selected
	-check brightness/swap the monitor to see if it is the computer or monitor that is broken
	-IF no video after windows loads then use VGA mode (F8)
**Image Quality problems**: flickering, color patterns incorrect
	-check the cable pins especially if you're missing color
	*Distorted Image/Geometry*-> check the resolution settings as you need to make the display specifications of the monitor
-LCD displays are fixed (number of pixels doesn't change) so you have to match the native resolution to make the image the sharpest 

**Burn-in**: problem across al monitor types
	-when you have a image that is displayed so often that it is imprinted onto the display (pixel shift is helpful in not letting this happen)
	*LCD*->display a white screen for a while to try and reset the screen
**Dead pixels**: pixels that are always black
	-can't be fixed on the user side and is not a cable/power issue
	-you'll have to replace the LCD to actually fix it
**Flashing screen**: 
	-check the cable as it is usually a loose cable
	-you have replace the entire display to fix this SO FIRST confirm that it is the monitor by swapping it with another to see if its the computer
**Incorrect color display**: colors are not properly represented on the display
	-first look at the monitor settings (tint, custom color presents) and try a factory reset 
	-check the driver of the computer graphics OR the night shift may be on
