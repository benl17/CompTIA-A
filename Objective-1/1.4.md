**Cellular Networks**
-land is separated into grids/cells with an antenna at each joint with certain frequencies
*2G Networks:* 
	-GSM (Global system for mobile comm): Used multiplexing so that everyone gets a slice of time and SIM cards so phone number traveled between phones 
	-CDMA (Code Division Multiple access): Everyone communicates at the same time with each call using a different code 
*3G Technology:*
	-upgraded data connectivity over 2G with bandwidth improvement and intro of GPS, mobile TV and video on demand
*4G and LTE (Long Term Evolution):*
	-Converged GSM and CDMA providers with standard download of 150MB
*5G:*
	-Significant performance improvement with 10GB per second at best
	-less constraint on bandwidth and larger data transfers
*PRL (Preferred Roaming List):*
	-CDMA Networks and can be updated on the air

**Mobile Device Connectivity**
*GPS:*
	-Created by US Department of Defense with over 30 satellites in orbit
	-Calculates based on timing differences from 4 different satellites 
*MDM (Mobile Device Management):*
	-Manage all company owned or user owned devices at work
