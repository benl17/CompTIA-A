**Laptop Displays**
*Portable LCD*
	-Liquid Crystal Display: Light shines through liquid crystals
<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px;">Advantages: </span>
		-lightweight, relatively low power/inexpensive
<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px;">Disadvantags: </span>	
		-black colors are a challenge, requires separate backlight (difficult to replace)
	-**TN (Twisted Nematic LCD)**
		-original LCD tech with fast response time BUT poor viewing angles that cause color shifts
	-**IPS (In Plane Switching)**
		-excellent color representation BUT more expensive
	-**VA (Vertical Alignment)**
		-good compromise between TN and IPS but slower response time then TN
*OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)*
	-Organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current
	-Thinner and lighter (Tablets, phones and smart watches) as no glass is needed
*WiFi Antennas*
	-multiple antennas are needed to wrap around to the top of laptop screen so make sure to connect them if you ever disconnect them
*Webcams*
	-Built in camera and microphone but not always great quality video/audio
*Backlight*
	-CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp): high voltage and power needed
		-adds thickness to the display and no longer very common
	-LED Backlight LCD Display: backlight is led in an array of LEDs behind the screen and most new laptops now use this
*Inverters:* some laptops need these to convert dc to ac, can use a flashlight directly at the screen to make sure the backlight is working

*Digitizer:* use a pen like device as input, used commonly on laptops and tablets
