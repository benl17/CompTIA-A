<h1>Cloud Models</h1>
-more than just servers hosted somewhere else, allow you to deploy and infrastructure in minutes 
-International scope as you can deploy across the world
-cost is based on the amount of use so you can scale down your operation at night (shut down some instances) when you don't expect there to be as much traffic in order to save money

**Private cloud**: a companies own personal data center that no one else can use
**Public cloud**: available to every (AWS, Google, etc)

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)**: Web servers
	-basically buying time on some else's hardware in order to run 
	-still responsible for your own management and security
**SaaS (Software as a service)**: Google Mail, Microsoft 365
	-on demand software with no local installation (payroll, email distribution)
	-users don't have to build or maintain their own application they can just use one that is already done
	-SaaS is responsible for management and keeping the data safe
**PaaS (Platform as a service)**: SalesForce
	-NO servers, software, maintenance team, HVAC
	-someone else handles the platform while YOU only handle development
	-you only have access to what the platform manager allows you to have such as modules you can put together (log in page, check in/check out)

<h3>Cloud Characteristics</h3>
**Shared resources**
	*Internal Cloud*:
		-no resources are shared 
		-pay for everything up front so NO ongoing costs after
	*External Cloud*:
		-share resources with a public cloud (AWS, etc)
		-cost may be metered or up front 
		-infrastructure is owned by a third a party
**Rapid Elasticity**: scale up/down as you need without users ever noticing
**High Availability**:
	-Systems are always available even if one or multiple servers go down
	-it is highly redundant
-Files in one cloud location is available in another cloud location using file synchronization 

**DaaS (Desktop as a service)**:
	-applications are running on a remote server 
	-local device is the keyboard, mouse and screen
	-doesn't require a not of memory or CPU power ONLY YOUR NETWORK connection really matters
