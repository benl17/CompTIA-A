<h1>Client Side Virtualization</h1>
-One computer running many different OS (macOS, windows, Linux) OR a different version of an OS at the same time (windows 10, windows 11)
-The OSs may think they have their own CPU, memory, network, etc BUT they are all actually sharing the same hardware
-Allows you the ability to run different application versions on the same system such as legacy software

**Hypervisor (virtual machine manager)**:
	-manages the virtual platform and guest OSs
	-every OS is managed as if it has its own hardware

*Intel->*Virtualization Technology (VT)
*AMD->* AMD-V

-Need a lot of RAM for all the OS
-Need a lot of Disk space as each OS has its own image/space requirements
-Each OS may require a different network connection

**Sandboxing**: an isolated testing environment with no connection to the real world or production system
	-allows developer to try some code or break some code with no repercussion
	-allows for roll backing to a previous snapshot 
**Hypervisor security**:
	*VM Escaping*-> malware realizes it's on a VM and tries to compromise the hypervisor, malware can then jump from one Os to another
**Guest operating system security**:
	-every guest is self contained so use traditional security controls such as:
		-host based firewall
		-anti-virus/spyware software

*Shared network address*-> VM shares the same IP address as the physical host BUT has a private IP address internally 
*Bridged network address*-> VM is a device on the physical address so it has a unique IP address that other devices can communicate too
*Private Address*-> VM doesn't communicate outside of the virtual network
