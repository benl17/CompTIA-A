<h1>Storage Devices</h1>
**HDD (Hard Disk Drives)**: 
	-Non volatile magnetic storage as the data persists even if no power
	-Involves rotating platters and components that will limit the access speed
	-Random Access-> can retrieve data from any part of drive at any time
**SSD (Solid State Drive)**: 
	-no more moving parts but still non volatile memory
	-very fast performance than HDD since no moving parts
	-can use SATA interface which makes SSD easy replacements for old drives
**mSATA (Mini SATA)**:
	-shrink the SATA drive into smaller devices that are great for phones/laptops
	-now no spinning drive but was quickly replaces by m.2

**ACHI (advanced host controller interface):**
	-Designed for hard drives and not SSDs so if you try using SATA for connecting your SSD then you are probably limiting your throughput 
**NVMe (Non Volatile Memory Express)**:
	-the answer to the above problem as it is designed for SSD speeds
	-lower latency and higher throughputs
	-uses the M.2 interface instead of SATA interface as a result
**M.2**:
	-much smaller than SATA forms as no power cables, gets all the power from the motherboard slot
	-can use PCI express bus giving you up to 4 GB throughput 
	-Make sure that you get the right key slot 
-MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR MOTHERBOARD OPTIONS TO SEE IF IT SUPPORTS NVMe OR AHCI, THE RIGHT M.2 KEY
**Flash Drives**:
	-EEPROM (electronically erasable programmable read-only memory)
	-non volatile memory
	-there is a limited number of writes BUT unlimited number of reads
	-Not designed for archival storage as they can be lost easily
	-<span style="color: blue;">SD, Flash Drive, mini/micro SD</span>
**Optical Drives**:
	-small bumps that are read by a laser beam
	-slow and not very good for storage
	-CD, DVD, Blu-ray

<h3>RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)</h3>
-RAID is not a back but rather just a new way to maintain uptime/availability
-Different RAID levels with some that are redundant and some that are not
**RAID 0 (Striping)**:
	-split the file data between two disks
	-ZERO REDUNDANCY 
	-high performance with data written quickly

**RAID 1 (Mirroring)**:
	-Duplicate file data between two or more disks
	-HIGH REDUNDANCY with HIGH DISK SPACE REQUIREMENT

**RAID 5 (Striping with parity)**:
	-Split file data between minimum 3 different disks like RAID 0 but with the addition of a parity block
	-Efficient use of disk space with HIGH REDUNDANCY, parity calculation may affect performance a little bit
	-Parity blocks allows you to rebuild the data that you lost if one of the disks fails

**RAID 10 (Stripe of Mirrors)**
	-Combines the speed of striping with the redundancy of mirroring 
	-need at least 4 drives
