<h1>MFD (Multifunction Devices)</h1>
-Printers, scanners, fax, network/phone line connection 
-These can be very large machines so make sure you have the power, network, AND accessibility to make it work correctly

**Drivers**: specific to the printer model and needs to be exactly right as they CANNOT be mix and matched

**PCL (Printer Command language)**:
	-common across the industry
**PostScript**:                                   
	-popular with high end printers

*USB type B/Ethernet*-> most common wired connectors for printers

**Wireless device sharing**:
	-*Bluetooth*: limited range but can be convenient
	-*802.11 infrastructure mode*: many devices can use the access point to connect to the printer
	-*802.11 Ad hoc mode*: no access point but rather a direct link between wireless devices

**Sharing the printer**:
	*Printer Share*-> this allows for other people on the network to look for this printer using its name BUT everyone loses access to the printer once that computer is turned off
	*Printer server*-> doesn't need a third party computer to print but rather just connect right to the printer, usually has a web based front end that helps to queue and manage jobs on the printer
**Configuration Settings**:
	*Duplex*-> saves paper by printing on both sides but not all printers can do this
	*Orientation*-> portrait v landscape
	*Tray settings*-> printers will have multiple trays with different types of paper (plain, letterhead, etc)
	*Quality*-> resolution (high def or less defintion), color/no color

**Printer Security**:
	-printer ink isn't cheap so using user authentication as to who can print can help to save money
	-*Audit Logs*: tells you who printed, what paper they used, # pages printed
	-*Secured prints*: printer must support this but you can define a passcode/pin for each employee that they have to use to print

**Flatbed scanner**: 
	-all in one multifunction device 
	-you can send the sacn to your/someone else's email or even scan to the cloud
