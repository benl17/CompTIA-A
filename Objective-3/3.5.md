<h1>Computer Power</h1>
-ALWAYS DISCONNECT FROM POWER SOURCE WHEN WORKING ON A DEVICE
**Computer Power Supply**:
	-computers use DC voltage but most power sources provide AC voltage
**Amp & Volt**:
	-*ampere (amp, A)* is the rate of electron flow past a point in 1 second
	-*voltage (volt, V)* is the electrical pressure pushing the electrons 
	-*watt (W)* is the measurement of real power use 
		<span style="color: red; margin-left: 30px;"> watts = volts * amps</span>
		<span style="color: green; margin-left: 30px;"> 120V & 0.5A = 60W</span>
**AC (Alternating current)**:
	-direction of current constantly reverses
	-distributes electricity efficiently over long distances 
**DC (Direct current)**:
	-current moves in only one direction with a constant voltage

-Voltage varies by country so make sure to check that your power supply is the correct one
-Power supplies have switches that allow you to switch between 120 (US) and 230 (Europe)

-Voltage is calculated as a difference in the potential where the electrical ground is a common reference point 
<span style="color: blue;">Second floor is +10 feet (from the front door of your house)</span>
+12 V->PCIe adapters, hard drive motors, cooling fans
+5 V->some motherboard components with most now using +3.3V
+3.3 V=-> M.2 slots, RAM slots

-12 V-> integrated LAN, Older serial ports, some PCI cards
-5 V-> mainly for legacy systems

*24 Pin motherboard power*:
	-main motherboard power that provides +3.3 V, +/-5 V and +/- 12 V
	-legacy boards may only be 20 pin but this will still work with it
-some servers or computers may have two or more power supplies so that if one fails then the other can take its place, also easy to swap out power supplies without having to power it down

-Some power supplies can be modular(plug and play wires as you need them) but are more expensive
