<h1>Laser Printers</h1>
	-combine laser, high voltage, charged ions, powdered ink, heat and paper
	<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">High quality</span>
	<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">fast printing speeds</span>
	<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">many moving parts</span>
	<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">messy on the inside</span>
	<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">requires on printer memory</span>
<h3>Important Parts</h3>
1) *Imaging Drum*: image is "painted" onto the paper with a laser by transferring toner to the paper, easy to access
2) *Fuser Assembly*: heat and pressure is applied to melt the plastic toner powder onto the paper permanently 
3) *Transfer Belt and Roller*: color laser printers (cyan, yellow, magenta, black) with four separate toner cartridges 
4) *Pickup rollers*: picks up the papers a single page at a time, should be cleaned or replaced periodically 
5) *Separation Pad*: pulls just the top sheet from the paper tray, small and inexpensive and is replaced periodically as well
6) *Duplexing Assembly*: part that allows for the paper to be printed on both sides, mechanism that is built in or added later to flip the paper
<h3>Printing Steps</h3>
1) *Processing*: nothing is moving yet, just receiving data from user 
2) *Charging*: a negative charge is sent to the photosensitive drum that clears it so it is ready for a new image to be printed
3) *Exposing*: Laser creates a positive charge on the photosensitive drum
4) *Developing*: negative charged toner sticks to the positive charged areas from the laser causing it to stick to the photosensitive drum
5) *Transferring*: transfer the toner on the photosensitive drum to the paper
6) *Fusing*: toner is fused to the paper permanently using heat and pressure
7) *Cleaning*: little bit of toner is left behind on the photosensitive drum and is cleaned off 
<h3>Maintenance</h1>
**Replacing toner cartridge**:
	-look for messages from the printer 
	-Toner also probably contains the OPC (Organic Photoconductor Drum) drum so which is also sensitive to light so keep it in the bag
	-Power down printer before doing this, pretty safe
**Laser Printer Maintenance Kit**:
	-usually has replacement feed rollers, new fuser unit, and a guide to how many pages you can print before you should perform maintenance 
	-AGAIN power down before replacing components
**Laser Printer Calibration**:
	-can be automated or manual
	-print a page and then based on the color you will adjust to make it better
**Laser Printer Cleaning**:
	-printers are dirty-> water/isopropyl alcohol (should avoid harsh chemicals)
	-water for outside and inside to wash away dust
	-Isopropyl alcohol for cleaning the rollers

<h1>Inkjet Printers</h1>
<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">relatively inexpensive</span>
<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">quiet & high resolution</span>
<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">Ink is expensive & Proprietary</span>
<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">eventually fades (not good for archiving</span>
<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">clogs easily</span>
**Ink cartridge**:
	-place drops of ink onto the page that are pulled from cartridges
	-CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)
**Print head**:
	-in SOME, NOT ALL, consumer printers 
	-whenever you would replace the ink cartridge you would also get a new print head
**Feed Rollers**:
	-pick up and feed paper through the printer
	-must be cleaned and maintained routinely
	-SOME support duplexing
**Ink Cartridge**:
	-ink is on a belt carriage that will go back and forth across the page
	-another moving part which isn't always a good thing
**Calibration**:
	-align nozzles to the paper so that colors
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
-Print heads need to be ensured they are not clogged as this is a BIG ISSUE these printers suffer from
-Cleaning process can be done manually or automatically by the printer
-not a big deal if they are clogged as they can be replaced easily
**Replacing inkjet cartridge**:
	-some printers will have a separate cartridge for each color (CMYK) or some will combine together CMY and keep K separate
	-pretty easy to replace and will calibrate itself
**Clearing Jams**:
	-lots of twists and turns while printing
	-remove the paper tray and then try to remove the paper from the path then check for any scraps that may be stuck then you're good
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h1>Thermal Printers</h1>
-uses special white paper covered with a chemical that turns black when printed, NO INK!
<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">VERY quiet</span>
<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">paper is sensitive to light and heat (not good for archiving)</span>
**Feed assembly**:
	-uses friction to keep the paper in place with gears on the side that will feed the paper through the machine
**Heating Element**:
	-full length heating element across the whole paper with NO MOVING PARTS
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
-thermal paper is relatively inexpensive but NEED TO ENSURE you buy the correct size
-Pretty easy to actually replace the paper, just replace the spool like TP
**Cleaning heating element**: cleaning pen or Isopropyl alcohol
**Cleaning Thermal paper**: 
	-compressed air or damp cloth on the paper to get paper bits or dust off the paper and inner mechanism 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h1>Impact Printers</h1>
-Print head printer with a small matrix of pins that presses against a ribbon to make a mark on paper
<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">good for carbon/multiple copies</span>
<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">low cost per page (just need the ink)</span>
<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">NOISY</span>
<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px">poor graphics (not very detailed)</span>
-Print head moves back and forth with the ribbon to print on the page
**Printer Ribbon**:
	-fabric with one long never ending circle of ribbon
	-easy to replace as it is one single unit
	-the ribbon size is proprietary to the printer so make sure to get the correct size
**Tractor feed**:
	-continuous paper feed where the paper usually has holes on the side of the paper to make it easier to move (NO FRICTION)
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
**Print head**: takes a lot of abuse as it is constantly being pressed down onto the paper 
	-gets very hot so watch your fingers 
**Replacing paper**:
	-doesn't have a conventional paper tray so the paper must be fed into holes perfectly 
	-need to ensure there are no constraints on the feed (nothing in the way)
------------------------------------------------------------------------<h1>3D Printers</h1>
-create an electronic model and it is then printed in three dimensions
-*additive manufacturing*: built in layers with no machining process
-rapid prototyping to design and create relatively inexpensive
**Filament printing**:
	-melt the filament to then print the objects
	-goes layer by layer as it moves up
	<span style="color: green; margin-left: 40px">larger print bed, easy to manage filament, minimum mess and fewer disposal issues</span>
**Resin Printing**:
	-Smooth and finely detailed 3D printing than filament
	-liquid resin is hardened by a light source
	-build platform starts at the top and then works down
	-resin must be handled properly (WEAR PROTECTIVE GOGGLES and TAKE LEFTOVER RESIN TO A WASTE MANAGEMENT SITE)
