<h1>Network Cables</h1>
**Twisted pair copper cabling**:
	-two wires with equal and opposite signals (Transmit+, Transmit-/Receive+, Receive-)
	-Twisted part is key as when the data is moving through the cable it is constantly moving away from interference

**Coaxial Cords**:
	-Two or more forms share a common axis
	-RG-6 used in TV/Digital cable

-*Plenum* is an area where hot air that would usually be going back into the AC is just floating in the same area as our network cables-> in the case of a fire we need to ensure that the cables in this area will not be blowing hazardous smoke 
**Plenum-rated cable**:
	-if using ethernet in a plenum then YOU MUST USE a low smoke PVC coated ethernet cable-> makes it less flexible but safer in case of a fire
**UTP (unshielded twisted pair)**: no additional shielding, most common twisted pair cabling 
**STP (shielded Twisted Pair)**: when you need more protection from possible interference, requires the cable to be grounded
<span style="color: blue;">U = unshielded</span>
<span style="color: blue;">S = braided shielding</span>
<span style="color: blue;">F = foil shielding</span>
how to tell: <span style="color: red;">(Overall cable)/(Indiv Pairs)TP</span>
	braided shielding around entire cable and foil around the pairs = <span style="color: green;">S/FTP</span>
**Direct Burial STP**: when overhead cable isn't a good option, put in the ground
	-designed to be waterproof and often filled with gel to repel water

<h3>Optical Fiber</h3>
-Fiber communication is done by light transmission
-No radio frequency signal which makes it a little safer from someone trying to steal information
-signal is slower to degrade allowing for transmission over long distances
-Immune to radio interference 
*Multimode fiber*: 
	-used more for short range communication (up to 2km)
	-relatively cheap light source (LED)
*Single mode fiber*: 
	-long range communication (up to 100km)
	-expensive light source (lasers)

<h3>568A & 568B Colors</h3>
-568 is a standard put in place by the TIA (Telecommunication Industry Association) that creates standards for the US
-568 is used for when you need to punch down RJ45 and most use 568B standard
-Whichever you choose to use you must use it on both sides of the cable or it won't work

<h3>Peripheral Cables</h3>
**USB (universal serial bus)**-> printers, storage devices, keyboard, mouse, etc
	-*USB 1.1*->low speed (1.5 Mbits over 3 meters) and full speed (12 Mbits over 5 meters)
	-*USB 2.0*-> 480 Mbits over 5 meters
	-*USB 3.0*-> 5 GBs over ~3 meters
	-When we upgrade USB the names of past USB versions will change 
		-<span style="color:green;">USB 3.0 changed to USB3.1 Gen 1 when it was updated</span>

**Thunderbolt**: high speed serial connector with data AND power on the same cable
	-based upon Mini DisplayPort standard
	-40 GBs throughput with latest version (v3)

<h3>Video Cables</h3>
**VGA (Video Graphics Array)**: DB-15 connector with a blue color (due to the PC system design guide)
	-video only, NO AUDIO
	-Analog signal with limited range of 5-10 meters
**HDMI (High definition multimedia interface)**: Video AND audio stream
	-around 20 meter range
	-19 Pin (type A) connector with a proprietary connector
**DisplayPort**: Digital information sent in packetized form
	-similar to ethernet and PCI express that carries both audio and visual
	-Compatible with HDMI and DVI (if you have a cord with DisplayPort on one side and HDMI/DVI on the other then it will work)
**DVI (Digital Visual Interface)**:send video signals over single/dual link
	-*single link*: 3.7 GBps (HDTV at 60 fps)
	-*dual link*: 7.4 GBps (HDTV at 85 fps)
	-no audio support

<h3>SATA (Serial AT Attachment)</h3>
-*SATA 1.0*-> 1.5 GBps over 1 meter
-*SATA 2.0*-> 3.0 GBps over 1 meter
-*SATA 3.0*-> 6.0 GBps over 1 meter
-*SATA 3.2*-> 16 GBps over 1 meter
-used exclusively inside of our computer, IF you are using SATA for an external hard drive then you are using eSATA (external SATA, 2 meters AND THE CABLES ARE DIFFERENT SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ONE)
-power has 15 pins AND data has 7 pins THAT ARE SEPARATE OF EACH OTHER

<h3>SCSI Device Cables</h3>
-Small Computer Systems Interface
-Originally designed to string many peripherals together into one "chain" (up to 16 devices on one SCSI chain)
<span style="color: green;">Advantages</span>
	-Not just for hard drives but rather scanners, tape drives, CD ROM drives
	-Many devices on a single bus (8 on narrow, 16 on wide)
	-Very intelligent interface functionality (just give it the basics and SCSI will take it from there)
	-Has a long industry longevity even if it isn't as popular anymore
**SCSI ID and Logical Unit (LUN)**:
	-every SCSI device on a single bus is assigned a separate ID number
	<span style="color: blue; margin-left: 20px;">Example: SCSI ID 0 (Controller), SCSI ID 2 (Hard Drive), etc</span>
	-There needs to be a terminator at the end of the SCSI cable so that you can communicate with all the devices at the same time

**Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)**:
	-moved from parallel to serial which INCREASED throughput 
	-point to point connection so no more daisy chains and NO MORE termination

<h3>PATA Device Cables (Parallel AT Attachment)</h3>
-Originally called IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) which was created by Western Digital and had a 2nd generation
-Speeds have increased going from 16 MBs to 133 MBs
-went from 40 wire to 80 wire in order to decrease the amount of cross talk between wires

<h3>Adapters and Converters</h3>
**DVI to HDMI**: electronically compatible
	-HDMI is backward compatible with DVI-D so no signal conversion is required 
	-no loss of video quality
**DVI to VGA**:analog to analog
	-only 640x480 is officially supported with DVI-A
	*IF YOU WANT TO DO VGA TO DVI*-> you will need a converter
**USB to Ethernet**: useful with computers that don't support ethernet out the box
**USB Hub**: usually includes a plethora of interfaces with only one connection to computer

<h3>Copper Connectors</h3>
**RJ11 Connector**: 6 position, 2 conductor wire for telephone/DSL connection
**RJ45 Connector**: 8 position, 8 conductor wire for modular/ethernet connection
**F Connector**: Cable television, cable modem, single wire with a screw on system
**Punchdown Block**: Wire to wire patch panel where wires are punched into the block
**Molex Connector**: 4 pin peripheral power connector
	-provides 12 and 5 Volt power
	-useful for devices inside a computer case like storage, optical, and fans

<h3>Fiber Connectors</h3>
**LC (Local Connector)**: smaller type of Fiber connector that has two separate fiber connections with one for sending and one for receiving
**ST (Straight Tip)**: Bayonet connection where you insert the end and twist 1/4
**SC (Subscriber Connector)**: usually combines two together and is square
