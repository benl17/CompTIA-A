<h1>Motherboards</h1>
**Form Factors**:
**ATX (Advanced Tech Extended) Form Factor**:
	-has lot of memory and expansion card slots
	-Standardized by Intel in 1995 but has seen many updates over the years
	*Power*-> 20/24 Pin connector with additional 4/8 pin for CPU if needed
**ITX Form Factor**:
	-low power motherboards for small form factor
	-screw compatible with ATX if you want to put it inside a larger case

<h3>Expansion Slots</h3>
**Computer Bus**: communication paths that allow for different parts (like RAM and CPU) to talk to each other quickly
**Conventional PCI (Peripheral component interconnect)**:
	-many expansion options like 32/64 bit bus width and parallel communication
	-legacy device with *PCI express* being the new update
**PCI Express**:
	-uses a serial connection that has multiple lanes
	-one, two, four, eight, sixteen, or thirty-two full duplex lane options that allow for slower devices to NOT slow everyone else down

<h3>Motherboard Connectors</h3>
-24 Pin Motherboard power connector but can connect a 24 pin connector to a 20 pin mother board connector if motherboard only supports 20 pin
-Connector is pinned a certain way so you cannot put it in backwards
**4 Pin ATX**:
	-an additional 12 volt power for older motherboards & used primarily for CPU
	-may be labeled ATX12V, P4, or CPU and is also keyed
**eSATA expansion**:
	-expansion card that allows for more SATA connections out the back of your computer
**Headers**: AKA pin headers
	-usually around the edges of motherboard 
	-Many different uses:
		-Power
		-Peripheral connections (USB, Audio, etc)
		-lights
		-buttons
**Front Panel connectors**: Pins used for the power button, reset buttons on case

<h3>Motherboard Compatibility</h3>
-Need to decide between Intel and AMD (AMD little less expensive)
-Motherboards are designed for a particular CPU (AMD doesn't work with Intel motherboard)
**Server Motherboards**:
	-mutlisocketed which allows for expansion in the future, split the load
	-usually at least 4+ memory slots and many expansion slots
	-Large ATX sized system meant to fit into a rack 
**Desktop Motherboards**:
	-usually single CPU 
	-usually 2-4 memory slots with limited options for expansion slots
**Mobile Motherboards**:
	-small and light with CPU limited in speed (want efficiency)
	-CPU will thermal throttle so that it doesn't damage itself when HOT
	-limited system modification such as memory, CPU, etc
	**System Board**:
		-proprietary that is built to fit THAT computer
		-replacement isn't easy so if any component on the board stops working then you have to swap the entire board

<h3>The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)</h3>
-the software/firmware used to start your computer, almost exclusively uses flash memory nowadays 
-initializes CPU and Memory to build the workspace
-*POST (Power on Self Test)*: checks to see if you have memory, CPU, video and any type of peripherals 

**Legacy BIOS**:original/traditional BIOS 
	-older OS talked to the hardware through the BIOS instead of accessing the hardware directly
	-limited hardware support with no way to improve the BIOS
**UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) BIOS**:used in most modern computers
	-designed by Intel, allows different manufacturers to created their own BIOS using a defined standard 
**Settings**:
	*Del, F1, F2, Ctrl-S, CTRL-ALT-S*: launch the system setup
**Fast Startup**:
	-default on Windows 8, 10, 11 where the system doesn't actually power all the way when you shut it off which is why it can start up so quickly and you can't open the configuration menu
		1)*Hold Shift when clicking restart*
		2)*settings/update & security/recover/adv startup/restart now*
		3)*system configuration (msconfig)*
		4)*interrupt normal boot up three times and then presents options*

-Make a backup of your BIOS configuration before changes in case you mess up (which is easy to do)
-Don't make a change unless you're certain you know what the setting does 

**Boot Options**:
	-If you don't want your OS having access to certain parts of your hardware then you can change that in boot options
	-Can also modify the boot order or move it from your HDD to SSD
**USB Permissions**:
	-you cannot disable USB connections from your BIOS in case you want to be more secure 
**Fans**:
	-since computing creates a lot of heat, you need fans to cool it down
	-you can control what your fans will do in your BIOS 
**Secure Boot**:
	-Part of UEFI specification 
	-uses digital signatures to verify that the boot process is not modified (keeps malware out of your system)
	-supported in many different operating systems 
	*checks the OS bootloader's digital signature with the BIOS's manufacturer public key to ensure that it is a trusted certificate*
**Boot password management**:
	-requires a password in order for the system to boot up
	*Supervisor password*->restricts BIOS changes to those that have password
	-if you forget the password then you must *reset it with a jumper* which clears all the current settings
**TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**:
	-specification for cryptographic functions, needed if you have encrypted data
	-Persistent memory that comes with unique keys burned in during production
	-allows you to send data with a digital signature unique to this device
	-password protected 
**HSM (Hardware Security Module)**:
	-often used in large environments like clusters or redundant power
	-could be used as a key backup for all the servers on your network
	-high end cryptographic hardware

<h3>CPU Features</h3>
-32 bit processors can access 2^32 values (4GB) (x86)
-64 bit processors can access 2^64 values (17 billion GB) (x64)
-hardware drivers you install must match the correct architecture (64 bit is backwards compatible but 32 bit cannot run 64 bit applications)

**ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)**:
	-CPU developed by Arm Ltd that other companies can license and build
	-efficient/fast  processing with less power/heat 
	-perfect for mobile devices

**Processor Cores**: processing is done on the cores
	-Dual/Quad/Octa/Multi core 
	-each cores has its own cache with sometimes cores sharing a cache
**Multithreading**:
	-CPU cores using HTT (Hyper threading tech) where one core can operate as multiple cores
	-isn't actually as fast as multiple cores but does have 15-30% boost
	-OS has to support it with most nowadays supporting it
**Virtualization support**:
	-run other OS within a single hardware, multiple OS share the same physical hardware components

<h3>Expansion Cards</h3>
-hardware OR a driver extends the functionality of your computer 
*Sound Card*:
	-allows for high end audio output OR ability to input audio for podcasting or music capture
*Video Card*:
	-most CPUs already have integrated graphics but aren't very good
	-external graphics card are Discrete graphics
*Capture Card*:
	-video as an input-> video capture and live streaming
*NIC (Network Interface Card)*:
	-motherboard might not include an ethernet connection or maybe you want additional connections (servers, routers, etc)
-make sure to check motherboard documentation so that you know for a FACT that the card is compatible

<h3>Cooling</h3>
*Case fans*: cool air is pulled through a personal computer
	-always important to check for good airflow such as pulling in through the front and pushing out through the back
*On board fans*: adapter card designed to cool other adapter cards
	-can be bulky and takes an adapter card space
	-perfect for high end graphic cards that tend to get off
-standard sizes are 80mm, 120mm, 200mm with different speeds and noise levels
*Passive cooling*: no fans and no noise
	-common on small devices like media server or apple TVs
*Heat Sink*: copper or aluminum alloy that dissipates heat through thermal conduction
	-Fins/grid increase the surface area where heat is transferred to the tips which have access to cooler air
-Thermal paste/pad are needed to ensure that there is a good enough connection between chip and the cooling part
*Liquid cooling*: coolant is circulated through a computer 
	-mostly in higher end systems that need great cooling
	-gaming, overclocking, etc
