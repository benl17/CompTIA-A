<h1>Memory</h1>
*RAM (Random Access Memory)*: high speed and temporary memory 
-Used to transmit information very quickly between memory modules and the CPU 
**DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module)**: Dual because the electrical contacts on each side of the stick are different than the other side
	-64 bit data width
**SO-DIMM (Small outline-DIMM)**: about half the width of DIMM and used mainly in phones and laptops
**DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)**: the black rectangles you can see (usually)
	-needs constant refreshing or else the memory will disappear
	-Random part comes from the ability to ask the RAM for a certain part of memory and it sends it instantly
**SDRAM(Synchronous DRAM)**: syncs with the common system clock
	-queue up one process while waiting for another 
	-old DRAM didn't wait for the clock signal

**SDR (Single data rate) vs DDR (Double Data Rate)**
	-SDR can only transfer ONE bit of data in one clock cycle where as DDR can transfer TWO bits of data every one clock cycle

**DDR3 (Double Data Rate 3)**:
	-twice the data rate of DDR2
	-has larger chip capacities of 16GB per DIMM
	-NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY    
**DDR4**:
	-max 64 GB per DIMM (ram stick)
	-still no backwards compatibility
**DDR5**:
	-still max 64 GB per DIMM but faster throughput than DDR4
	-still no backwards compatibility 

<h3>Memory Technologies</h3>
**Virtual Memory**: AKA virtual RAM/swap file that allows you to take data from RAM and put it in a special area of your storage device for temporary storage
**Multi-channel memory**: Dual/triple/quad channel that takes the throughput that would usually be sent to only one memory module and spreads it across multiple modules
	-if you want to use this then ensure that you properly install memory in the correct slots on your motherboard (usually colored the same)
**Memory that checks itself**: usually used on computer systems that house VM/Database/any server
	-*Parity memory*: adds an additional parity bit BUT doesn't always detect an error and can't actually correct the error
		-there has to be an even number of 1's in order for the data to be correct
	-*Error Correcting Code*: detects and correct errors on the fly, motherboard has to support this
